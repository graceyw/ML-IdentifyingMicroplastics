# Identifying Types of Plankton with Machine Learning

## What is this?
#### Determine application and data set
We developed a machine learning model that identifies the kind of plankton displayed in an image. To train our convolutional neural network, we used a dataset of over 200,000 images of 65 kinds of plankton, which we got from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Open Access Server. The dataset can be found [here](https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/7341).

## Why does it matter?
Microplastics end up in the ocean and can potentially get into our food
(cite paper)

## How does it work?
#### Explore data set (look at some images and create some visualizations to understand your data). You will very likely need to downsample your images.

##### Create a plan for initial analysis (get feedback on this plan?)

## Important considerations
Every model has limitations. Here are a few important ones to acknowledge:

#### Understand the source of your data (see project description on github for some good starter questions about the source and who labeled, etc.)

#### Brainstorm important considerations for your application, algorithm, and data.
- Does everyone use this one dataset? What does that mean for the efficacy/robustness of the models in this space?
- Potential limitations of data:
  - Not using real microplastics? Bought em
